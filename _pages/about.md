Thank you for visiting my website! 

I'm a fourth year Mechanical Engineering Undergrad at UC Berkeley (graduating Dec 2025), working towards applying for PhD programs in Mechanical Engineering this fall. Currently contributing to a robotic assistive device research project at the ([EDG Lab](https://edg.berkeley.edu/)) working with Junpyo Lee and Drew McPherson under mentorship of Dr. Hannah Stuart.

My past ([research experiences](https://akhavana.github.io/research/)) include robotic control for motion planning and grasping manipulation, biomedical assistive devices, manufacturing and design, and engineering materials. Alongside research, I have some passion projects ([personal projects](https://akhavana.github.io/personal/)) which I take on to learn new skills and gain better understanding of various engineering areas. 

Another passion of mine is STEM outreach. I actively work with K–12 students, helping them learn about science through projects and hands-on experiments. I really enjoy supporting youth as they discover their interests in STEM. I also mentor new college students, helping them navigate resources, providing guidance, and ways to build skills.
